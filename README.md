Auto Timezone WordPress Plugin

This WordPress plugin is designed to automatically convert published date and
time information into the local timezone of the user visiting your site. 

Use a shortcode like this:

[autotimezone datetime="2017-09-10 21:00:00"]

Where datetime is the date and time you want converted in the following format:

YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

in your local timezone(the timezone that WordPress is set to use).
